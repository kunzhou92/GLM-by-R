# STATS 202C Project 3

**project1.R** and **project1.cpp** contain R code and C++ code, respectively which are integrated by Rcpp. The report is in **project1.pdf**.

## Importance sampling and the effective number of samples

- Given target distribution, compared the convergence rate for different approximate distributions.
- Estimated the number of “effective samples”.

## Estimating the number of Self-Avoiding-Walks in an (n+1) x (n+1) grid

- Counted total number K of SAWs for n=10. Compared 3 different designs for the trial probability.
- Counted the total number of SAWs that start from (0,0) and end at (n,n).
- Plotted the distribution of the lengths of the SAWs in a histogram. Visualized the longest SAW in print.
